# Project: Pixel Art Maker
This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## The Project Details
In this project, we are given a starter template by Udacity. Using this template, I'm building the script to do the following:

* Upon form submission, build the grid.
* The form provides the number of rows (via the grid height) and columns (via the grid width).
* The grid is a table.
* Upon clicking on a single grid square, color that square's background color to the currently selected color.
* Build it with jQuery
